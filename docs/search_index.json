Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 2. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 2.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 2.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Abbildung 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Donâ€™t miss Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(pressure, 10), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Tabelle 2.1: Here is a nice table! temperature pressure 0 0.0002 20 0.0012 40 0.0060 60 0.0300 80 0.0900 100 0.2700 120 0.7500 140 1.8500 160 4.2000 180 8.8000 "]]
